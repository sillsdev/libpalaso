	/// <summary>
	/// Provides a more robust version of System.IO.File methods.
	/// The original intent of this class is to attempt to mitigate issues
	/// where we attempt IO but the file is locked by another application.
	/// Our theory is that some anti-virus software locks files while it scans them.
	///
	/// Later (BL-4340) we encountered problems of corrupted files suspected to be caused
	/// by power failures or similar disasters before the disk write cache was flushed.
	/// In an attempt to fix this we made as many methods as possible use FileOptions.WriteThrough,
	/// which may slow things down but is supposed to guarantee the data is really written
	/// all the way to something persistent.
	///
	/// The reason some methods are included here but not implemented differently from
	/// System.IO.File is that this class is intended as a full replacement for System.IO.File.
	/// The decision of which to provide a special implementation for is based on the
	/// initial attempt to resolve locked file problems, and the later problems
	/// with cached writes.
	///
	/// These functions may not throw exactly the same exceptions in the same circumstances
	/// as the File methods with the same names.
	/// </summary>

  them available to .NET Standard clients.

- [SIL.Windows.Forms] Remove unnecessary dependency on NAudio
- [SIL.Core] Deprecate `ExceptionHandler.Init()` method in favor of more explicit version
  `ExceptionHandler.Init(ExceptionHandler)`, e.g. `ExceptionHandler.Init(new WinFormsExceptionHandler())`
- [SIL.Core] Move `HandleUnhandledException()` method from derived classes to base class

### Fixed

- [SIL.Windows.Forms.Keyboarding] Merge missing `Keyman*Interop.dll` into the assembly (#865)
- [SIL.Windows.Forms] Use signed version of `ibusdotnet.dll` (#865)
- [SIL.Windows.Forms] Merge `Interop.WIA.dll`, `DialogAdapters.dll`, and `MarkdownDeep.dll` into the assembly
- [SIL.Media] Fix missing `irrKlang.NET4.dll` exception by copying it to lib folder in output

## [7.0.0] - 2019-08-29

### Changed

- Create nuget packages
- [SIL.Media] `IAudioRecorder.SelectedDevice` now returns a `IRecordingDevice` which both the
  NAudio and AlsaAudio `RecordingDevice` implement. This allows to use the same assembly
  on both Windows and Linux (although the limitations what works and what doesn't work remain the
  same)
- [SIL.Media] cleanup of `AudioSession` API: rename `AudioIrrKlangSession` to `WindowsAudioSession`.
  `AudioAlsaSession` and `WindowsAudioSession` are now  internal (they were never intended to
  be used directly)
- [SIL.Media] move some interfaces around so that they live in `SIL.Media` instead of
  `SIL.Media.Naudio`: `IAudioRecorder`, `RecordingState`, `IAudioPlayer`

### Added

- [SIL.Core] new properties for processor architecture: `Platform.ProcessArchitecture` and
  `Platform.IsRunning64Bit`
- [SIL.NUnit3Compatibility] new project/package that allows to use NUnit3 syntax with NUnit2
  projects

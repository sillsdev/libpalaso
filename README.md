API Policy
----------

The palaso library follows semantic versioning. For APIs this means:

 * public APIs that become deprecated will be marked as obsolete.
 * The API and its obsolete tag will remain through the beta versions and at least one more stable version.
 * The API will be removed in one of the next stable versions.

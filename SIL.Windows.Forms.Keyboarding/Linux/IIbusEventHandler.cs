	/// <summary>
	/// Event handler interface for IBus events.
	///
	/// This interface can be implemented by an application that needs specific behavior with
	/// IBus preedit handling. For example FieldWorks implements a handler to allow in-place
	/// edits of IBus in views.
	///
	/// IBus 'keyboards' can actually be more elaborate input methods involving a pop-up window
	/// in which the user makes choices before text is definitely "committed" as typed into the
	/// control. Another variation involves entering some "pre-edit" text actually into the
	/// control which may not be the final version, like an 'a' which might get replaced with a
	/// composite ae if e is the next keystroke. This calls for interaction between a control
	/// and the IBus adapter so that the control can choose where to place the pop-up and to
	/// allow the keyboard to manage the pre-edit text.
	///
	/// If the application implements this interface it will need to pass an instance
	/// when registering the control (<see cref="KeyboardController.RegisterControl"/>).
	///
	/// If the application doesn't implement this interface a default event handler
	/// (<see cref="SIL.Windows.Forms.Keyboarding.Linux.IbusDefaultEventHandler"/>) will
	/// be used that works with a WinForms TextBox.

	/// <summary>
	/// At a high level, this class is used to ensure that a given token (based on a unique string)
	/// can only be obtained by one process on the whole system.
	/// Each process is only allowed to acquire one token.
	/// The process should release the token when it is no longer being used;
	/// however, my testing shows that if the process crashes, it will still release the token.
	/// 
	/// Though it could have uses outside of this, the orginal use of this class is to accomplish
	/// enforcement of a single instance application.
	/// Though it has not been tested, it should also work to enforce an application being able
	/// to have multiple instances where each instance has a unique project open.
	/// For the former, pass the application name as the uniqueIdetifier (e.g. "Bloom").
	/// For the latter, the client could pass the path of the project file as the uniqueIdentifier.

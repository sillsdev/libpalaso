	<abstract>
	  <p>Role is an attribute of both the Creator and Contributor elements. (Please note that Dublin
	  Core now discourages the use of the Creator element, recommending that all Role information be
	  associated with Contributor elements.) This document specifies the controlled vocabulary of the
	  Role attribute used by OLAC. This attribute specifies the functional role of the entity named
	  in the creation of a given resource.</p>

	  <p>Each term of the controlled vocabulary is described in one of the
		following subsections. The heading gives the encoded value for the term that is
		to be used as the value of the <i>code</i> attribute of the <i>Contributor</i> metadata
		element <cit>OLAC-Metadata</cit>. Under the heading, the term is described in four ways.
		<i>Name</i> gives a descriptive label for the term. <i>Definition</i> is a one-line summary
		of what the term means.
		<i>Comments</i>  offers more details on what the term represents, and may also include
		 examples given to illustrate how the term is meant to be applied.</p>
		<p>Additional roles may be found in the MARC Relator set <cit>MARC-RELATOR</cit>. Any MARC
		 term that does not appear in the OLAC Roles set defined below may be used in the sense
		 defined in the MARC document. The roles defined here are either very commonly used to
		 characterize the creators of linguistic resources, or have been re-defined to reflect
		 specifically linguistic practice. Some examples of MARC Relator terms that may be used
		 without modification are 'copyright_holder','artist', 'metadata_contact', 'director',
		 and 'calligrapher'.</p>

		<comment>
			<p> The choice between 'interpreter' and 'translator' may depend on the dynamics of the resource creation
		  event or process. Generally, if the participant is translating 'live'; that is, while the speaker or signer is
		  speaking or signing, she or he should be identified as an interpreter. Also, some discourse genres include a
		  participant who interprets or explains a performance of some kind.</p></comment>

		  another chief has just performed, thus completing the ceremony.</p></examples>

		contribute substantially to its content.</definition>
		<comment>
		  <p>This role is intended for minor participants such as audience members or other peripherally-involved
		  participants in the event.  These interlocutors need not have been physically present.  They could be
		  participants in some form of long-distance communication, such as lurkers in an online discussion, or they
		  may have participated in the general sense of having allowed the event to take place, such as the
		  mayor of an indigenous community.</p>
